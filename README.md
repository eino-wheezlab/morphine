* [Manage your time with Morphine: a better web blocker for Chrome](http://www.freewaregenius.com/2012/06/20/manage-your-time-with-morphine-a-better-web-blocker-for-chrome/)

Todo:

* Fix incognito behavior.
* Better icon and promo graphics.
* Run at certain times of the day?
* Possibly allow per-site productivity adjustment? For example, Google Reader is usually more productive than Facebook.
* Add the blocking rule to the bottom of the Morphine tab next to the blocked URL.
* Add some identifying information to the Morphine tab title (e.g. blocking rule or a reduced URL).
* Upgrade to the v2 manifest, with a minimum Chrome version.
