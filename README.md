Ideas:

* Improve incognito behavior.
* Improve icon and promo graphics.
* Only enforce blocking at certain times of the day? Certain times of the week, e.g. only weekdays?
* Possibly allow per-site productivity adjustment? For example, Google Reader is usually more productive than Facebook.
* Pause meter when switching to non-blocked tabs?
* "Parking meter-style anti-procrastination"
* Optional daily balance reset time.
* Disable button? (Workaround for Chrome automatically closing all open blocked tabs when disabling manually.)
* Optional manual balance cap setting.
* Optional personal block message setting.
* Balance reset button.
* Only accrue balance during certain times of the day.
* Quick-add current domain to block list.
* Personal block page message(s).
* Disable option that doesn't close all blocked tabs.
